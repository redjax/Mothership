# Scripts [META] <!-- omit in toc -->

This is a "meta" repository for all of my machine scripts, configurations, & dotfiles.

Each repository is a [Git submodule](), its own independent repository that is "joined" here in an overarching repository that groups my most important repositories for computer management.date
